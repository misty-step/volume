# Vision

## One-Liner

Volume is a chat-first workout tracker where an AI coach replaces traditional UI pages with generative, context-aware interfaces.

## North Star

One conversation surface replaces everything. No dedicated pages for logging, analytics, settings, or history. The agent proactively renders the right components at the right time, responds to natural language, and lets users interact with generated UI directly. Opening Volume feels like resuming a conversation with a coach who already knows what you need.

## Key Differentiators

- **Chat-forward, not chat-only.** The agent generates rich, interactive UI components on demand — not just text responses.
- **Proactive intelligence.** The agent surfaces insights, suggestions, and relevant context before the user asks.
- **Pre-demand rendering.** On session start, the agent assembles a personalized dashboard based on activity history, time of day, recovery state, and goals.
- **Direct manipulation + natural language.** Users can interact with generated components (edit sets, bulk operations) OR describe changes in plain text. Both paths converge.
- **Transparent and recoverable.** Every agent action is auditable, undoable, and explained.

## Target User

Anyone who tracks workouts and wants the friction removed. Power users who log daily. Beginners who need guidance. People who find traditional workout apps tedious.

## Current Focus

Build the agentic foundation:

1. Deep generative UI component library (set logging, history tables, analytics cards, bulk edit, suggestions)
2. Agent tool system that maps natural language to mutations with full recoverability
3. Proactive session assembly — agent knows what to show when the user opens the app
4. Migrate existing page functionality into agent-renderable components
5. Design token refresh to support beautiful generative interfaces

## Non-Goals (For Now)

- Social features, wearable sync, B2B coaching dashboard
- These may return later but are secondary to the agentic core
