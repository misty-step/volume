let's improve the analytics and past set viewing in the log sets flow

some use cases i frequently have that the current design doesn't adequately support:

- i want to do 100 pushups over the course of the day and, in the log set view, i can't see the total number of pushups i've done today
- i want to see not just a line by line of my most recent dumbbell curls, say, but i want them reasonably grouped so i can more easily tell how many sets i did on any given day, what my trends are for reps per set and number of sets per workout and weight etc are, and how that has changed over not just the past couple days, but the past couple weeks etc
